On your way to work, a commute that stays the same
thinking of your tasks, and how you'll start the day
I'll write some code, take breaks to play a game,
But what will I have for lunch, you'll say?

It'll be tasty and healthy
It'll be assembled with love and precision
One thing it will definitely not be
is a point of indecision

Lunch will be a puzzle
cobbled together from different pieces
And at home you can give your pet a proper nuzzle
Cuz you've prepped, so dinner will be just as easy

All the pieces will be at your fingertips
Complex carbs, protein, fiber and vegetables
which will leave no room for a craving for chips
but with just enough flexibility to combine your comestibles as you wish

And your coworkers will ooh and aah
and your loved ones will love you more
and asked how you managed to put together such a plate
without it being a chore
and you'll quickly reply
you too can meal prep! just use this app, and you'll have healthy delicious food on the fly!
