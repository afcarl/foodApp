Mappings:

mapping: component - component
mapping: ingredients - component
mapping: cook_type - component
mapping: component - meals

a meal (node) has (relationship) ingredients (node)
component (node) is an ingredient of (relationship) an ingredient (node) 

example:
meal 1 has pesto, green beans, black beans, squash
garlic, herbs, oil, acid nuts are ingredients of pesto
onion and garlic (ingredients) are ingredients of (sauteed onion and garlic)(component)
(sauteed onion and garlic)(component) is an ingredient of black beans (component)


Relationship notes:
        
component-ingredient relationship attributes:
    - order
    - prep (e.g. dice)
    - time to cook
    - proportion
    - add/remove (boolean)
    - is optional (boolean)
    
component-component relationship attributes:
    - order
    - proportion
    - time to cook - this goes in the relationship between component and finished component
    - add/remove (e.g., bouqet garni gets removed) (boolean)
    - is optional (boolean)
component-cook_type relationship attributes:
    - method of cooking (e.g. roasted, rub (for marinade), mixed (for raw), tossed (raw)
    - equipment
    
meal-component relationship attributes:
    - serving suggestions
    
Node notes:
- component
    - shelf life. shelf life means how long a finished product will stay fresh. this could imply:
        - how much time you have to eat it (if its a final product)
        - how much time can elapse before you use it to make another component (e.g., how far in advance you can prep it.)
    - nutrition type (e.g. startch, protein)
    - from scratch 
- cook type
    - can take on values cook, raw, marinated, fermented
    - has attributes equipment
    
  
 QUESTIONS:
 - how do we indicate when the same pan should be use throughout?
     -perhaps through shelf life? if both have a very low shelf life, cook in two pans
     
 - TARA: we were talking about node duplication. there will be a lot of duplicative 'cook' nodes (remindder takes on values cooked, raw, marinated, fermented.) i think this is fine?
