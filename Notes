formal grammar
make a grammar of food combinations
completeness


ontological or semantic completeness

the same ontological structure can give rise to contradictory semantic meaning
thru fuzzy logic - logic that is context dependent.

formal grammars can be represented as graphs

formalize rules for this grammar and then apply to other data

1. i should define axiomatic rules of the grammar

2. or the machine can define rules of the grammar (heuristic)
