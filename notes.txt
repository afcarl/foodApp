add set query to replace existing values (e.g.,white vinegar is diced in the black bean salad)
view associated ingredients when you do a search
clear fields when page refreshes
create a cook type node
is zest a relationship attribute between lemon and a component, or is zested lemon its own ingredient?



formal grammar
make a grammar of food combinations
completeness


ontological or semantic completeness

the same ontological structure can give rise to contradictory semantic meaning
thru fuzzy logic - logic that is context dependent.

formal grammars can be represented as graphs

formalize rules for this grammar and then apply to other data

1. i should define axiomatic rules of the grammar

2. or the machine can define rules of the grammar (heuristic)
